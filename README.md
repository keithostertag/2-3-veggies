# Veggies in Space

For your convenience and viewing pleasure this webpage is hosted at: card16.com/veggiesinspace

This page was created to showcase a series of photographs of common garden vegetables lit and arranged to appear as though they are "floating in 
space". The design presents the images in a space theme; the title refers to the old "Lost In Space" TV show- "Lost 
in Space Veggies". The header image uses the "Will Robinson" font from DeNada Industries and the "AlphaGarden" font from Beeline.

When the user scrolls the page the header/banner collapses and its background becomes transparent, mimicking the effect of fading into the distance.

Clicking the fixed position spaceship icon reveals a floating spaceman holding a sign providing the contact email address for the page. In order to 
thwart spambots, the displayed email address is an image (rather than text). Clicking on the email sign displays the contact form.

An about page is displayed by clicking on the Lost in Space Veggies banner image.

Text content for each image is provided with mouse over, except in mobile where the text is always displayed.

Clicking on an image links to its full size page.

The text on the each page was kept to a minimum in order to emphasize the images and the "space".

Javascript was kept to a minimum as an exercise, and to make the site as usable as possible for users not having javascript turned on. Jquery is only 
used for loading a new random background image on refresh, and javascript to implement the collapsing header feature, neither necessary for content. 
The email validation is through HTML5 only.

I designed the favicon as a stylized lightning bolt. My domain "card16.com" refers to Card 16 of the Tarot - The Lightning Struck Tower.
