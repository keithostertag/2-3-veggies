# 2-3 Veggies in Space
Site to demo progressive design for Responsive Design and other features (3rd in series of 3).

For your convenience and viewing pleasure this webpage is hosted at: card16.com/2-3/

The initial motivation for this page was to showcase a series of photographs of common garden vegetables lit and arranged to appear as though they are "floating in space". This third design moves further to present the images in a space theme, changing the title to refer to the old "Lost In Space" TV show- "Lost in Space Veggies". The header image uses the "Will Robinson" font from DeNada Industries and the "AlphaGarden" font from Beeline.

When the user scrolls the page the header/banner collapses and its background becomes transparent, mimicking the effect of fading into the distance.

Clicking the fixed position spaceship icon reveals a floating spaceman holding a sign providing the contact email address for the page. In order to thwart spambots, the displayed email address is an image (rather than text). Mouse over the spaceman and he moves toward you.

Text content for each image is provided with mouse over.

Clicking on an image links to its full size page.

This design does not provide an "about" page, and text on the page was kept to a minimum in order to emphasis the images.

I designed the favicon as a stylized lightning bolt. My domain "card16.com" refers to Card 16 of the Tarot - The Lightning Struck Tower.
